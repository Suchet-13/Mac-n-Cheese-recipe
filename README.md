# Mac-n-Cheese recipe
in this project, i will teach you how to make mac-n-cheese.
------------------------------------------------------------
ingredients:
1 pound dried macaroni pasta
1 1/2 cups whole or 2% milk, divided
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
2-3 cups shredded cheese of your choice
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon powdered mustard
------------------------------------------------------------
recipe:
1) Cook the pasta
Bring about 4 quarts of salted water to boil over a high heat in a large pot. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until about 8 minutes. Drain and set aside.

2) Warm the milk
Pour 1 cup of milk in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Meanwhile, pour 1/2 cup of milk and flour in a small bowl and whisk together until there are no lumps. When you just start to see whisps of steam rising from the warming milk, whisk in the milk-slour mixture. Continue whisking gently until the milk thickens slightly to the consistency of heavy cream for 3 to 4 minutes.

3) Make the cheese sauce
Turn the heat to low and begin mixing handfuls of cheese in the milk. Stir in the salt and mustard. Stir until all the cheese has melted and the sauce is creamy. Taste and adjust the seasoning as desired. Remove the sauce from the heat.

4) Combine the pasta and cheese sauce
Place the pasta and 1/2 of the cheese sauce in a large serving bowl. Stir to coat the pasta evenly. Add the remaining sauce and any extra add-ins and stir to combine. If you'd like a more loose sauce, add up to another 1/4 cup milk if desired. Serve the Mac-n-Cheese immediately while still warm.
